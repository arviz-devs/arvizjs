# ArviZ for JavaScript

ArviZ for JavaScript. The goal of having ArviZ in JavaScript is to allow for static site
creation, and maintain some of the statistical computations you can do in Python or
Julia, but using JavaScript. As the ArviZ Dashboard package becomes more mature, it will
leverage the JavaScript computations more.
